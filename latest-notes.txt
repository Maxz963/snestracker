Pitch Modulation Feature
-------------------------

1) Instrument Editor Button

 a) Acts as the Influencer part of PMOD (to the voice above).
 b) Acts as the Influenced part of PMOD (from the voice below).

2) FX Command

 a) see 1a
 b) see 1b


HARDWARE Note: PMOD voice bit, causes that channel to be INFLUENCED by the activity

How To Implement a New Feature
------------------------------

A new feature that's gonna use the 

. ~~GUI~~
. The APU Driver
. ~~File loading & File Saving~~
. ???

- Instrument APU Ram
TODO:
File Loading / Saving

To unlock the coolest uses of PMOD:
1. Unlock lower levels of octaves
2. Make playing notes at 00 volume allowable.
    --> Make 0x80 the blank value for volume column (?)
