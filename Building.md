Building
========

Three flavours of pre-built SNES Tracker binaries are available for you!
- **OLD**: simply download from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker/releases).
- **LATEST**: With any purchase from the [Gift Shop](https://shop.snestracker.com/) you'll receive a one-time instant download link to the latest version of SNES Tracker.
- **LATEST+INTERIM**: As a thank you to my [Patreon](https://patreon.snestracker.com/) Supporters, who help to keep this project going, the latest version of SNES Tracker is available exclusively via Patreon a few weeks before it becomes available on github. Support me and this project by becoming a Patreon Supporter and you will not only receive a download link to the latest stable version each time it is released - you'll also unlock access to the very latest interim builds, experience up-to-the-minute bug fixes, features and improvements weeks before anybody else. Aside from builds access, you can also earn privileged roles in our Discord community, receive generous shop discounts, exclusive behind the scenes updates, and more!

Alternatively, you may perform any of the following compilation scenarios:

- compile native on OS X
- compile native on Linux
- cross-compile for Windows from Linux
- compile native on Windows

Dependencies
------------

Here is a general list of external dependencies. Further below are OS-specific instructions.

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - >=2.0.3-r200 - newer versions may be compatible
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/history/ "Boost") >=1.56.0-r1 - a newer version of Boost is likely compatible - need only compile the following: 
  - boost\_system
  - boost\_filesystem
- imagemagick (for icon rendering)
- wla-dx deps
  - cmake
- Linux-only deps
  - gtk 2 or 3 (`pc/Makefile` refers to gtk2 by default)
  - alsa-lib (rtmidi dep)

## Mac OS

I recommend using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the system dependencies. Once homebrew is installed, simply run the following command from the terminal.

```
brew install sdl2 boost cmake
# Now we get and build SNES Tracker
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh
make
```

If you are building a distribution release, use `make OSX_BACKSUPPORT=1`

## Linux

### Apt (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)

```
apt install libasound2-dev libsdl2-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libgtk2.0-dev cmake imagemagick
```

```
# Now we get and build SNES Tracker
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh
make
```

### Gentoo Linux

On Gentoo, I recommend putting the following packages into a set

**/etc/portage/sets/snestracker**

```
media-libs/libsdl2
dev-libs/boost
x11-libs/gtk+:2
media-libs/alsa-lib
dev-util/cmake
media-gfx/imagemagick
```

```
emerge --ask --verbose @snestracker
```

```
# Now we get and build SNES Tracker
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh
make
```

<details>
<summary>Removal</summary>
<br>
Should the time come to release the dependencies associated with snes
tracker, simply:
<pre>
emerge --deselect @snestracker
# depclean as usual when you are ready to cleanup your system of unused dependencies
emerge --ask --depclean
</pre></details>


Cross-Building for Windows
--------------------------

Here are 64-bit cross build instructions for Gentoo or Ubuntu Linux.

## Gentoo

### 64-Bit

```
emerge -av sys-devel/crossdev
crossdev --target x86_64-w64-mingw32
x86_64-w64-mingw32-emerge -av dev-libs/boost
```

Then compile SDL2 manually. (Don't use `emerge` for sdl2 or you will miss out on video hardware acceleration)

```
wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.10.tar.gz
tar -zxf SDL2-2.0.10.tar.gz ; cd SDL2-2.0.10
./configure --prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/usr --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 \
--enable-sdl2-config=no --with-sysroot=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/usr/include
make && sudo make install
```

```
# Now we get and build SNES Tracker
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh

prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/usr CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-w64-mingw32- make
```

Provided that compilation was successful, the following DLLs need to be copied into the directory where the EXE will be located.

```
cp /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/usr/{bin/SDL2.dll,lib/libboost_filesystem.dll} \
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/9.2.0/{libgcc_s_seh-1.dll,libstdc++-6.dll} pc/bin
```

Some of these library files are version dependent (eg. 9.2.0), so until an
automation strategy is discovered (static build?), be careful.

### 32-Bit

```
emerge -av sys-devel/crossdev
crossdev --target i686-w64-mingw32
i686-w64-mingw32-emerge -av dev-libs/boost
```

Then compile SDL2 manually. (Don't use `emerge` for sdl2 or you will miss out on video hardware acceleration)

```
wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.10.tar.gz
tar -zxf SDL2-2.0.10.tar.gz ; cd SDL2-2.0.10
./configure --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/usr --host=i686-w64-mingw32 \
--enable-sdl2-config=no --with-sysroot=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/usr/include
make && sudo make install
```

```
# Now we get and build SNES Tracker
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh

prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/usr CROSS_COMPILE=i686-w64-mingw32- make
```

Provided that compilation was successful, the following DLLs need to be copied into the directory where the EXE will be located.

```
cp /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/usr/{bin/SDL2.dll,lib/libboost_filesystem.dll} /usr/lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/9.3.0/{libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll,libstdc++-6.dll} pc/bin
```

Some of these library files are version dependent (eg. 9.2.0), so until an
automation strategy is discovered (static build?), be careful.

## Ubuntu

### 64-bit

(tested on 16.04), You can use the following commands to setup the build environment.

```
# System deps
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mingw-w64 pkg-config

# SDL2
wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.12.tar.gz
tar -zxf SDL2-2.0.12.tar.gz
cd SDL2-2.0.12
./configure --prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 \
--with-sysroot=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include --enable-sdl2-config=no
make
sudo make install

# Boost
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.72.0/boost_1_72_0.tar.bz2
tar -jxf boost_1_72_0.tar.bz2
cd boost_1_72_0/
echo "using gcc : : x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ ;" > user-config.jam
./bootstrap.sh
sudo ./b2 --prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32 --with-system --with-filesystem \
  --user-config=user-config.jam toolset=gcc target-os=windows \
  variant=debug link=shared threading=multi address-model=64 install
```

```
# Now we get and build SNES Tracker
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh

prefix=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32 CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-w64-mingw32- make
```

Provided that compilation was successful, the following DLLs need to be copied into the directory where the EXE will be located.

```
cp /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/{bin/SDL2.dll,lib/libboost_filesystem.dll} \
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/5.3-posix/{libgcc_s_seh-1.dll,libstdc++-6.dll} pc/bin
```

Some of these library files are version dependent (eg. 5.3-posix), so until an
automation strategy is discovered (static build?), be careful.

### 32-bit

I haven't actually tested a 32-bit compile from Ubuntu, but it probably
involves installing `i686-w64-mingw32-g++` package and adapting the 64-bit
instructions in a similar fashion as can be observed from the Gentoo
instructions.

Windows Native
--------------

Building from Windows is now a thing! It's done using the msys mingw-w64 environment.


Install Msys2 https://www.msys2.org/
- Download and run the installer. After it's installed run Msys2 (Choose the msys2 mingw-w64 64-bit shell)
- Update the shell tools:

```
pacman -Syu
# If needed, close MSYS2, run it again from Start menu. Update the rest with:
pacman -Su
```

- Install the tools

```
pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
pacman -S make mingw-w64-x86_64-make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config # needed for SNES Tracker SDL2 flags
pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake # Needed to build wla-dx
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick # needed to build icons

# Optional CCACHE
pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-ccache
echo 'export PATH="/mingw64/lib/ccache/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Optional GDB
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb

# Note to self: Hacks for the use of CROSS_COMPILE prefix to get SNES Tracker to compile natively on Windows with the least amount of build system modification)

# Needed for libjdkmidi
ln -s /mingw64/bin/{ar.exe,x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar.exe}
ln -s /mingw64/bin/{ranlib.exe,x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib.exe}

# Needed to build icons
ln -s /mingw64/bin/{windres.exe,x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres.exe}
```


## Library Dependencies

Compiling natively on Windows actually uses SNES Tracker's cross compilation build system.
We are compiling these dependencies manually for a few reasons.
 - To have consistent results as the cross-compile build system expects.
 - To get certain library support that the official packages don't have (eg. Direct3D on SDL2)

### SDL

```
wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.12.tar.gz
tar -zxf SDL2-2.0.12.tar.gz
cd SDL2-2.0.12
./configure --prefix=/c/bazzsys/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --enable-sdl2-config=no
make && make install
```

### Boost

Note: Make sure your msys path is the same as mine below (C:/msys64), or adjust it as necessary.
```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.72.0/boost_1_72_0.tar.bz2
tar -jxf boost_1_72_0.tar.bz2
cd boost_1_72_0/
echo "using gcc : : x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++.exe ;" > user-config.jam
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 --prefix=C:/msys64/mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32 --with-system --with-filesystem   --user-config=user-config.jam toolset=gcc target-os=windows   variant=debug link=shared threading=multi address-model=64 install

# the SNES Tracker build system wants to see libboost_filesystem.dll naming convention like it's used on most other compilation scenarios, but the runtime
# dependency on the dll will use the crazy name.
pushd /mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/
	mv boost-*/boost .
	cd ../lib
	cp libboost_filesystem*.dll libboost_filesystem.dll
	cp libboost_system*.dll libboost_system.dll
popd
```

### Get and Compile SNES Tracker

```
git clone https://github.com/bazzinotti/snestracker.git
cd snestracker
./build-submodules.sh

prefix=/c/bazzsys/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32 CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-w64-mingw32- make
cp /mingw64/bin/{libstdc++-6.dll,libgcc_s_seh-1.dll} \
  /mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/{lib/libboost_{system,filesystem}-*.dll,bin/SDL2.dll} \
  /mingw64/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll pc/bin
```


Internal Dependencies
---------------------

The snestracker build system will automatically compile the following internally packaged deps:

- libjdkmidi (packaged internally, slightly modified to support build process)
- rtmidi (packaged internally)
- NativeFileDialog (packaged internally, and modified for cross-platform compilation)
- 7zDec (packaged internally, and modified for cross-platform compilation)
- unrar (packaged internally, and modified for cross-platform compilation)
